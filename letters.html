            <div id="desc">First of all I'm sorry because I don't reply earlier. I want to make all this and give to you on 14th Feb but I can't make it on time and I'm sorry .All I can do is apologize and nothing more. I've realized I've been such a dick to you and all the things you said is right. You are truly an amazing partner. The reason why I send you the link of website is just because I want to truly "give" it to you, cuz I made it for you. I want you to be able to keep it and open in not just keep that website in my computer. It wasn't my intention to make you feel guilty, but in the past I did mention that I feel like you didn't appreciate the website. I was wrong, so wrong. I always say how we should get our emotions together and all but me myself pon always lose control of my own emotions. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry for taking things for granted and let all of this happen.
